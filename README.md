# Hi there, I'm Stefan! 👋

I'm a Full Stack Developer based in Skopje, specializing in JavaScript and modern web technologies. I love building intuitive and dynamic user experiences. 

### 🎮 Currently Working On:
- **A Game using HTML5 Canvas & Unreal Engine**: Dive into a captivating world where creativity meets technology! I’m developing a game that leverages the simplicity and accessibility of HTML5 Canvas for web-based play while exploring the power of Unreal Engine for its stunning visuals and immersive 3D environments. It’s a unique blend of web development and advanced game design, where I bring characters to life and craft adventures that players will love to explore!
- **A Real-Time Chat App**: I’m working on a real-time chat app that’s all about connection! It’s designed to keep conversations flowing like a friendly banter at a café, complete with fun emojis and user-friendly features. I’m having a blast coding the backend while making sure the frontend is just as engaging!
